# Approach
 - Scaffold using Create React App
 - Basic POC to explore the capabilities of the API
 - TDD API calls
 - Basic unstyled components to display the results
 - Introduce Styled Components and begun styling (taking accessibility and colour contrast into account)
 - TDD Pagination logic
 - Style pagination

# Issues faced
1. Lots of time wasted initially due to create react act not working -> turned out to be an over-zealous anti virus program quarantining files as soon as they were created by create react app!
2. Difficult to find focus time outside office hours due to clingy 2 month old baby
3. Discovered late on (at pagination stage) there appears to be a limit on number of API calls over a given period. Would now need to refactor logic.

# Potential Future development
1. Further unit test coverage -> components. Logic mostly covered
2. Refactor to better handle API 403 responses
3. Refactor state handling in App.js to use a useReducer and make code cleaner and more readable
4. Wanted to add a "Change View" funtion to toggle between rows and tiles
5. Allow user to choose number of records per page
6. Implement ESLint rules and prettier



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
